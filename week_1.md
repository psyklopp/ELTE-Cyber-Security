# Week 1 > Sept 11 - 15

## Friday - Sept 15

### Cryptography Protocols - Practice

*   Nothing really happened
*   Teacher told us about the course and something about the thesis process and then let us go

I missed the first hour of the lecture because I thought it was supposed to start at 11:00 A.M. (like the meeting said)

## Thursday - Sept 14

### Provably Secure Modular Design of Cryptographic Protocols - Lecture and Practice

*   Introduction
*   Until the adversary types
*   No homework

The document he uses to teach, is different from what we are given. Thoughts?

## Tuesday - Sept 12

### Advanced Cryptography - Lecture and Practice

### Cryptography Protocols - Lecture

*   We were told about the structure and the grading scheme. Also started on the basics

## Monday - Sept 11

### Cryptography - Practice

*   Started from the very old encryption schemes which can also be termed as historic. The teacher from the lecture though mentioned that he wonâ€™t be teaching the old crypto stuff because he thinks they are worthless.
