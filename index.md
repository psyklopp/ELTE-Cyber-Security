# Week 4 > Oct 02 - 06

# <ins>HOMEWORK</ins>

*  Implement the secure handshake protocol in proverif - Cryptography Protocols
*  Implement the Nomenclator cipher - Canvas - Cryptography Pr.
*  Plan a little for Cyber Security Lab - the topic is already chosen
*  Prepare for a little quiz in Cryptography Protocols Lec. - all slides in Canvas

## Monday - Oct 02

### Cryptography - Practice - Semester 1 subject

*   Discussed a worksheet
*   Teacher shared answers and explanations. But not for all questions
*   In Canvas

## Tuesday - Oct 03

### Advanced Cryptography - Lecture

*  Making interactive proof non-interactive - reducing algorithms to something that can be proved by IP
*  Fiat-Shamir Heuristic - [Fiat-Shamir](https://www.zkdocs.com/docs/zkdocs/protocol-primitives/fiat-shamir/), [About ZKP](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/02/19/serving-up-zero-knowledge-proofs/)
*  Security of Fiat-Shamir - Bit security - 2<sup>-50</sup>
*  Security parameter for eg 2<sup>90</sup> computation steps
*  Ultimately every program/algorithm can be described as operations on the circuit level
*  Remember about the assignment/grading work

### Cryptography Protocols - Practice

*  No class this week

## Wednesday - Oct 04 - Free for me

## Thursday - Oct 05

### Provably Secure Modular Design of Cryptographic Protocols - Lecture and Practice

*  1.1.1 IND-CPA/CCA Security - Examples in RSA and El-Gamal
*  El-Gamal is CCA insecure - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption#Security)
*  1.1.2 EU-CMA - Existential Unforgeability Chosen Message Attack - Eg RSA [Purdue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/courses/Fall05/lectures/355_Fall05_lect30.pdf), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/mzv1q6/can_someone_explain_an_existential_forgery_attack/)
*  RSA is not EU-CMA secure - Hash-and-Sign with RSA is secure
*  One-way trapdoor functions - [StackExchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/101391/where-is-the-definition-of-one-way-trap-door-function-used-in-public-key-cryptog)
*  1.1.3 Secure key-exchange
*  Message Authentication Codes (MAC) - [Simple explanation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/message_authentication.htm)
*  1.2 Secure computation - Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) - Oblivious Transfer - ZKP - Secret auction bid
*  Security requirements of SMC + other properties

## Friday - Oct 06

### Cryptography Protocols - Lecture

*  Key-establishment
*  Diffie-Hellman Protocol - weakness + more secure version
*  DDH and CDH Assumptions
*  Quadratic Residue
*  **There might be a little quiz next week**
