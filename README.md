# ELTE Cyber Security

*All about the cybersecurity specialisation in ELTE - MSc Computer Science*

## A few words

I made this little space to keep track of my homework, assignments and related news easily. It may be useful for you if you are in the same cybersecurity specialization or if you are someone who is looking to study it in future!

## What to expect?

I will try my best to keep with the work and the schedule. And if you want to contribute to this little project, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request. It is also a good way of learning Git commands.

`Please note that me, the author, is in the 3rd semester so this repo might not have material for other semesters. Please contribute!`
